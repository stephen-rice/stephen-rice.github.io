# About the Author

Hello. I live in Cambridge UK, in a flat that either boils me alive, blinds me, or offers sweeping views of the [Gog Magog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gog_Magog_Hills) Hills.

When I'm not writing I enjoy video games, board games, musical instruments, or sometimes I try to sit still long enough to read. It's rare for me to watch a film without doing something else at the same time, unless I'm hungover and dying.


My favourite drink is whisky, unless I can find a gluten-free beer. My favourite food is indian, unless I can smell a nandos. My favourite music changes depending on my mood, from heavy metal to rock, retro wave or chillhop, unless I'm writing - in which case I trend towards movie or video game soundtracks.

I'm a relatively new writer, so everything takes twice as long as it should. I also work in software, and often wondered what I'd do if earned enough startup money for early retirement; the answer was always writing books. Turns out you don't need to retire to start.
