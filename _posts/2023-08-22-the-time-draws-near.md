It's been a long time coming, but I'm nearly done with the first draft of <i>A Murder of Crowns</i>. It follows Lily and Lark as they deal with their increasingly destructive powers, taking them from the frozen wastes of Hold Saar to the searing basin deserts of the Third Country -- a land where Goddeath is said to lie in slumber, bound by her rebellious priests and kept at bay by the Ageless King.

But in a nutshell: Sibling murder mystery in a dark fantasy setting, with an epic journey for a dubious cure.

## Website Update

Since there's only so many hours of the day I can draft and edit before words dribble into mush, I've been working on updating this website ready for a proper launch later this year. We're probably talking a 2nd edition of <i>A Handful of Souls</i>, with new covers and marketing. Leaving stealth mode, is the tech nerd term I will glibly steal here.

Up till now my goal was to get two books out before properly 'launching'. It's taken a while, but writing a sequel to something as bizarre as <i>A Handful of Souls</i> was an interesting challenge. I like escalating events towards chaos, but that is quite complicated when the surviving characters are all fairly escalated already.


## Newsletters and Prequel Novella

To know when pre-orders go live, you can join my mailing list. Panic not if things are a little quiet, the first newsletter will go out in the autumn once drafting and editing is nearing completion.

There will eventually be a free prequel novella for newsletter subscribers. It will cover some of the backstory for Dren and Terrano, with events leading up to things kicking off in a Handful of Souls.

Until next time!
