Ta da. After a year or so of tinkering with the old website, I have a better opinion about what I want. Wordpress felt over engineered a lot of the time, and its themes encouraged me to build a "business" site that felt too sprawling - I'm hoping this one has a bit more personality.

Designing the theme was easier than I expected. The best bit is that I can host it for free, since it's statically generated using jekyll. Winning!

## Writing Update

I'm working on the draft for the next Split Sea Novel, which now has a working title: "A Murder of Crowns". It's about dying kings, cursed thrones, a murder, and two siblings struggling to control their terrible powers. The first half is settled and is getting an alpha read. The second half has been plotted out into chapters.

While waiting for alpha feedback (thank ye, dear brother), I'm going to finish off this website.

Better get back to it!
