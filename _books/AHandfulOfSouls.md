Heat crept through the walls to coat Lark’s skin with a slick of sweat. His eyes closed, chasing the peace he’d just lost.

‘Are we alive?’ The voice was soft, almost a whisper. ‘Show me.’

Lark opened his eyes again.

‘Good.’ The voice’s owner was hunched over a nearby desk. He was fat and sweating profusely, scratching away in a book and mopping himself whenever his brow or squidgy nose threatened to blot the paper. He turned to Lark with a smile. ‘It’s a new beginning for you, my boy. Enjoy the blank slate while you can.’

The man held the smile for a moment, then turned back to his book.

Lark didn’t reply. He could wait. The world could wait. But it didn’t and wouldn’t and crept up on him with unwanted demands. He groaned as his skin stuck to the floor, each breath tightening a web of pain that gripped his chest.

The man coughed politely. ‘What is your name, may I ask?’

‘Lark,’ he managed.

‘Wonderful.’ He scribbled away for a few moments, then dropped his quill with a satisfied flourish. ‘Road greetings, Lark. My name is Terrano. My home city is quite far from here – in the Southlands, in fact.’

A land of spirits.

Despite the dozen or so oil lamps hanging around the room, Terrano raised one more to examine Lark’s face. Fresh tears blurred the man’s face to a painful halo. ‘Can you speak, my boy?’ he asked, lowering the lamp with an encouraging smile.

‘Water.’

‘Aha! Yes. Yes, yes, yes.’ Terrano chuckled to himself, but made no move to fetch any. He set down his lamp and checked the book with a finger. ‘An uncommon thirst on awakening, spasms of the back and neck, a fever unlike any other, visions and madness.’ He held the lantern up again. ‘Any spasms, Lark? Do you feel any spasms?’

‘…water, please.’

Lark’s hip ached, pressed down hard against the stone floor. Needles danced over his skin. Terrano was saying something else, but his voice sounded distant and tinny.

~

With a sinking sensation, Lark woke to find himself slumped in Terrano’s chair, a coarse blanket draped over his shoulders. The wind had forced its fingers inside and pushed past the door to ruffle the strange man’s book, which had been left open on the desk. Lark’s hand crept out to still the fluttering paper. Sketches of his naked body littered the page, cut apart by arrows and smeared with letters. As he watched, the words tumbled and ran over one another, until only his
name stood out clearly. It was written in Seatongue, and painted on using thick luxurious swirls of ink.

‘One moment, my boy. I’ll be with you in one moment.’ Terrano’s soft voice came from somewhere behind him. ‘Sip some water.’

A bowl had been placed on the desk. Lark scrambled for it, spluttering and sobbing with relief.

‘One moment. One moment.’

The empty bowl fell from Lark’s hands with a clatter. He looked around the gloom, wiping a dribble of tepid water from his chin. Cobwebs draped angles between a snapped mill shaft and rotten crossbeams. Someone had dragged a crate through the dust to a far wall, but despite the lanterns hung all around it, it was still cloaked in shadow, and the wood rippled and
twisted, crawling, skittering closer on hidden legs, a yawning, cavernous moan rattling through its warped planks as it leapt at him.

The moment passed. Terrano knocked a fist against the crate and waited for a response. None came.

‘Sere,’ Lark croaked, closing his eyes against the visions. ‘Where am I?’

He heard footsteps and opened one eye a crack. Terrano had spread his arms triumphantly, as if to deliver a hug, and an old panic gripped Lark, sparking life into his aching limbs.

‘Please! Please don’t—’

‘Such questions! I see you are recovering.’ Terrano placed his hands, mercifully, on the edge of the table. ‘I admit, I was worried when you collapsed. I thought I had picked a weakling at last, pushed myself too hard. But here you are. And truly, Lark...’ Terrano dropped his voice to a whisper. ‘Welcome back to the world of the living.’

He reached over and closed his book with a weighty thump.

An ornate carving was fixed to the cover, and the title – An Encounter with Death – was etched above a magnificent and thoroughly fictitious rendering of Terrano, his chin raised and nobility radiating from a generous smile. Lark looked up at him. A plump, piggy-faced scholar beamed back, reading
glasses dangling from his neck. He’d taken off his jacket and great puffs of lace bloomed over his clasped hands.

‘To answer your earlier question, Lark, you are a day’s ride north of the Split. This was not my first choice of refuge, but the weather conspires against me.’ Terrano paused, allowing the howling wind to intrude on their conversation. ‘The other subjects of my humble study are taking shelter nearby. Now, I understand from your papers you were volunteered for the
tax patrol?’
