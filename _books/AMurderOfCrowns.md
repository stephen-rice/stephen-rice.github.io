## Progress
Mostly trying to nail the ending of the first draft (200k+ words). First 50k has already seen heavy revisions because I sent it out for beta reads, and the rest is getting a lot of accidental revision as I sweep back through to remove bits of plot complexity or tighten things up before pushing to the end.

## Release date
I hope this year, but that depends on whether I'm nearing the end of my training montage. Writing a sequel was more challenging than I expected.
