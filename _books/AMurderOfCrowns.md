## Progress
First half is settled (50k words). I'm waiting for alpha feedback on that draft before going forwards with the rest of the plot. There's over 100k words of discarded plot lying around for me to draw upon as needed, but knowing my luck only about fourteen sentences and a made up word for gin will be useful.

## Release date
I hope this year, but that depends on whether I'm nearing the end of my training montage. Writing a sequel was more challenging than I expected.
