## Progress (90% drafted)
Mostly trying to nail the ending of the first draft (200k+ words). First 50k has already seen heavy revisions because I sent it out for beta reads, and the rest is getting a lot of accidental revision as I sweep back through to remove bits of plot complexity or tighten things up before pushing to the end.

## Release date
Towards the end of this year.
