         <div class="about-backdrop">
            <p>Dangerously enthusiastic author of the Split Sea novels, Stephen lives in Cambridge UK and writes software as well as books. Winner of absolutely nothing, he writes words that make you laugh, wince and cry - which is a fairly similar experience to reading his code. He has an ongoing obsession with electric string instruments. He is a slow reader. He is a terrible fidget. He is overly fond of a whisky or twelve in a loud bar before returning home and changing out of his sweaty clothes for some late night gaming.</p>
            <p>His current writing schedule is 'write until your brain melts, then play some cello and write some more', because he is incredibly behind. No matter what year you are reading this, it will almost certainly be true. Send him more of those encouraging emails about that character you liked so he doesn't give up. Failing that send him a Nandos.</p>

            <h4>FAQ</h4>
            <p><span class="contact-label">'Where have you been since releasing <i>A Handful of Souls?</i>'</span></p>
            <p>First draft of the next book in the series, <i>A Murder of Crowns</i>, is nearly finished. It's about twice the length and, to be frank, I've written it three times, trying to capture what people liked about the first book while continuing to work on my craft.</p><p>Writing a debut novel that people wanted to read felt like trying to catch lightning in a bottle. Writing its sequel felt like trying to mass produce lightning in a bottle. I am slow, but I am learning.
            <p><span class="contact-label">I've signed up to your mailing list, why are there no newsletters?</span></p>
            <p>First newsletter coming this autumn.</p>
            <p><span class="contact-label">I've signed up to your mailing list, where's my free novella?</span></p>
            <p>Once <i>A Murder of Crowns</i> is out the door I'd like to revisit some of the background lore and content cut from <i>A Handful of Souls</i> as a novella. This will be free to newsletter subscribers.
